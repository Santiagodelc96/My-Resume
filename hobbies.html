    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p>
      Outside of my working hours, I seek to distract my mind doing what I like
      the most.

        <h3>Motorcycling</h3>
        <p>
          I'm passionate about motorcycles and especially and I love Royal
          Enfield bikes. In fact, I have a meteor 350 that has taken me
          everywhere in Colombia. Also, I really like organizing the activities
          of the motorcycle group that I lead, the Meteor Mavericks.

        <h3>3D Printing</h3>
        <p>
          My love and affection for technology led me to buy a 3D printer. I
          like to print action figures, mechanisms, and things that are useful
          on a day-to-day basis and from time to time I like to customize the
          firmware of the printer, in order to improve its performance and
          capacity.

        <h3>Video Editting</h3>
        <p>
          I'm a very meticulous person with everything I do, especially when it
          comes to video editing. I use Adobe Premiere as my main editing tool
          and I am passionate about different filming techniques to give the
          content I create a professional touch
